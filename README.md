## 📌 Project Overview

The **YouTube Recommendation System** is a data-driven project designed to deliver **personalized video recommendations** based on user behavior such as watch history, likes, and engagement patterns. The system improves content discovery while minimizing information overload for users.

---

## ❓ Problem Statement

* Users struggle to find relevant videos among massive content availability.
* Lack of personalization leads to lower engagement and satisfaction.

---

## ✅ Solution

* Built a recommendation system that suggests videos tailored to individual user preferences.
* Ranked videos intelligently to ensure relevant and engaging content delivery.
